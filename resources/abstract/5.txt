Advances in the Internet and telecommunications technologies have spurred many research efforts in Internet-based unified communication systems, which integrate heterogeneous devices and networks (PSTN, cellular networks, or the pager networks). Nonetheless, these systems lack support for a systematic, easy, flexible way of customizing and creating services at the system level as well as at the user level. In this paper, we present such a service creation model by exposing a limited set of primitives from a call model that is network and device independent. Our model and framework not only supports the traditional telephony call services easily but also enables novel ways of creating third party services such as application-specific billing services
