Presented here is a unified approach to evaluating the error-rate performance of digital communication systems operating over a generalized fading channel. What enables the unification is the recognition of the desirable form for alternate representations of the Gaussian and Marcum Q-functions that are characteristic of error-probability expressions for coherent, differentially coherent, and noncoherent forms of detection. It is shown that in the largest majority of cases, these error-rate expressions can be put in the form of a single integral with finite limits and an integrand composed of elementary functions, thus readily enabling numerical evaluation
