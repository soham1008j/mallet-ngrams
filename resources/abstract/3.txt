Using a simple finite integral representation for the bivariate Rayleigh (1889) cumulative distribution function previously discovered by the authors, we present expressions for the outage probability and average error probability performances of a dual selective diversity system with correlated slow Rayleigh fading either in closed form (in particular for binary differential phase-shift keying) or in terms of a single integral with finite limits and an integrand composed of elementary (exponential and trigonometric) functions. Because of their simple form, these expressions readily allow numerical evaluation for cases of practical interest. The results are also extended to the case of slow Nakagami-m fading using an alternate representation of the generalized Marcum (1950) Q-function
