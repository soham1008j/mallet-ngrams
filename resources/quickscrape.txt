Enabling people-to-people interaction across heterogeneous communication end-points enhances user experience and fosters people collaboration. This paper presents the design and implementation of a unified communication system, dubbed Mercury, that allows a user to interact with others using the most convenient device at the time. Mercury supports both two-way conversation and one-way messaging. It leverages the Session Initiation Protocol to manage communication sessions and exploits dynamic user context to proactively route and migrate calls. It allows for subscription to other users' unified reachability status and provides a soft ring feature via universal notification. Mercury has an extensible architecture that allows new device types to be easily incorporated into the system. Our prototype implementation integrates a variety of devices: telephones, Sametime instant messaging clients, email, and pagers.
Presented here is a unified approach to evaluating the error-rate performance of digital communication systems operating over a generalized fading channel. What enables the unification is the recognition of the desirable form for alternate representations of the Gaussian and Marcum Q-functions that are characteristic of error-probability expressions for coherent, differentially coherent, and noncoherent forms of detection. It is shown that in the largest majority of cases, these error-rate expressions can be put in the form of a single integral with finite limits and an integrand composed of elementary functions, thus readily enabling numerical evaluation

Using a simple finite integral representation for the bivariate Rayleigh (1889) cumulative distribution function previously discovered by the authors, we present expressions for the outage probability and average error probability performances of a dual selective diversity system with correlated slow Rayleigh fading either in closed form (in particular for binary differential phase-shift keying) or in terms of a single integral with finite limits and an integrand composed of elementary (exponential and trigonometric) functions. Because of their simple form, these expressions readily allow numerical evaluation for cases of practical interest. The results are also extended to the case of slow Nakagami-m fading using an alternate representation of the generalized Marcum (1950) Q-function

In this paper, we develop a unified framework for linear nonregenerative multicarrier multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay communications in the absence of the direct source-destination link. This unified framework classifies most commonly used design objectives such as the minimal mean-square error and the maximal mutual information into two categories: Schur-concave and Schur-convex functions. We prove that for Schur-concave objective functions, the optimal source precoding matrix and relay amplifying matrix jointly diagonalize the source-relay-destination channel matrix and convert the multicarrier MIMO relay channel into parallel single-input single-output (SISO) relay channels. While for Schur-convex objectives, such joint diagonalization occurs after a specific rotation of the source precoding matrix. After the optimal structure of the source and relay matrices is determined, the linear nonregenerative relay design problem boils down to the issue of power loading among the resulting SISO relay channels. We show that this power loading problem can be efficiently solved by an alternating technique. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
